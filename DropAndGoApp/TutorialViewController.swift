If left blanked your name will appear as \"player\". Next you will select who your opponent will be, either computer or online player.\n\n Play the Game\n The game will start once you click a box in a column you like to drop your piece. After you select you column an X will appear on the board, then it will be your opponents turn. You will be Xs and your opponent will be Os. Once each square is filled, with only one single square still available, then you have completed the game. \n\n How to Score BIG\n For every move vertical or horizontal, you will earn 2 points. Diagonal plays will earn you 1 point. If you have box grouping of 4 ( 2 |x|x| on top and 2 |x|x| on bottom), you will earn 4 points."
